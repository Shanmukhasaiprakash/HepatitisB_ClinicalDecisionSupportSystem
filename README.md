Hepatitis B Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS)

Author: Shanmukha Sai Prakash Jeelakarra

Overview

This project implements a rule-based Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for Hepatitis B management using Exsys CORVID. It translates clinical guidelines from AASLD, WHO, and CDC into computable IF–THEN rules to support diagnosis, staging, and treatment recommendations. The system is designed to integrate into clinical workflows and aid healthcare providers in decision-making.

Motivation

Hepatitis B affects millions worldwide, and early detection and proper management are critical. Manual screening and guideline interpretation can be time-consuming and error-prone. This CDSS streamlines the process, helping clinicians determine infection status, immunity, or risk level efficiently.

Features

Rule-based decision engine built on Exsys CORVID.

Converts clinical guidelines into actionable IF–THEN rules.

Supports screening, diagnosis, staging, and treatment recommendations.

Workflow-focused design ensures easy integration into clinical practice.

Validated decision logic to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Technologies & Skills Used

Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS)

Exsys CORVID

Rule-Based Systems & Decision Logic

Healthcare Informatics

Medical Guidelines Interpretation

Usage

Open the .exsys project file in Exsys CORVID.

Input patient data (e.g., vaccination history, HIV status, symptoms, lab results).

The system evaluates the IF–THEN rules and provides diagnosis, staging, and treatment guidance.

Sample Data Questions

The system evaluates 20 key questions covering:

Vaccination history

HIV status and exposure risks

Symptoms

Laboratory results (HBsAg, Anti-HBs, Anti-HBc, ALT, AST, HBV DNA)
